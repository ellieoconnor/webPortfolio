# Introducing Myself: From Classroom Teacher to Full-Stack Developer
#### Published on 15 March 2025

Hi! My name is Ellie, and I'm a full-stack software developer.\
This is my first blog, and I'll admit, I'm feeling a little self-conscious about it. There are so many blogs out there–why add to the noise? Well, this blog isn't just for you; it's for me. It's a space for me to reflect, learn and grow as a developer. If you stick around, you may just find something valuable here too.

### My Journey So Far
My journey into software development started in an unlikely place: a special education classroom.\
Back in 2014, I learned just enough code to mock up some screens for my dissertation on assistive technology. At the time, I never imagined I could become a developer. I had all these preconceived notions about working tech that I used to gate-keep the field from myself.

In 2016, I landed my first job in special education. I loved the role, but I couldn't shake the feeling that students and teachers deserved better tools. In my department, we used three different programs just to write and track students' progress towards their IEP goals, and another seven websites and software programs to create instructional materials. It was overwhelming and inefficient.

That's when I started coding with a dream: to create a one-stop-shop for special education teacher–a tool that could handle IEP goal building, tracking, and resource creation all in one place. Step one? Learning web development basics, HTML and CSS (thank you FreeCodeCamp!).

My journey accelerated in 2022 when I left teaching. It was terrifying–teaching was all I'd known for nearly a decade–but I know it was the right move for me. I had been working my way through FreeCodeCamp and a Python book, but felt overwhelmed. Everywhere I looked on social media, someone had an opinion on the "best way to learn to code". And even more people wanted to sell their mentorship or knowledge for thousands of dollars.

On a coding Discord server, I discovered #100Devs, a free, live coding bootcamp hosted on Twitch. I had missed the first class but joined for the second one. That changed everything for me.\
The #100Devs classes and community helped me build a foundation I could stand on and continues to be a source of community and learning. I truly attribute my career change to that moment when I joined.

Today, I'm part of a lean team at the number one ERP system for the metal casting industry, putting my skills to work every day. 

### Why I Build This Blog
So, why a blog?

For me, writing is a way to solidify what I'm learning. When I put my thoughts into words, I understand them better. This blog is a space for me to explore the lessons I'm learning and talk about the projects I'm working on.

But, it's also about connection. I'm hoping to meet others who are on similar journeys–whether you're a seasoned developer, a career changer like me, or just someone who's curious about tech.

### Let's Connect
If you've made it this far, you're a legend and I appreciate your time and energy. If you'd like to see more of my work, stay tuned to this website. I'll be adding my projects over the next few weeks and posting more about my learning progress. You can find ways to connect with me on my "Contact" page.

I'm a big fan of virtual coffee chats and would love the chance to meet others.

I'm excited to share my journey with you, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.

Until next time,

Ellie
